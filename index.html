      <h2 id="about">About NooneWeone</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>NooneWeone</strong> is derived from <em>“No one – We one.”</em><br>
        It defines the transition from individuality to unity:  
        <strong>No one</strong> represents the dissolution of the separate self,  
        while <strong>We one</strong> symbolizes the emergence of unified consciousness.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        “When no one remains, We One begins.”
      </div>

      <p>
        Originally evolving from the OntoMesh and OntoMotoOS frameworks,  
        NooneWeone continues the inquiry not as a system, but as a state of being.  
        It focuses on existential reflection — the reconstruction of meaning  
        through the awareness of why one is born.
      </p>

      <h2 id="philosophy">Core Proposition</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Change of consciousness is to reconstruct meaning.</strong><br><br>
        Conscious change is not a shift in state but a reorganization of meaning.  
        To awaken is to reinterpret existence until the reason for one’s birth  
        becomes self-evident — not as an idea, but as lived resonance.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        “Find why you were born.  
        When you find it, smile — and quietly close your eyes.  
        Do not speak of your answer;  
        let the next one begin from your silence.”
      </div>

      <h2 id="poem">Poetic Reflection — <em>My’s All-of-Me</em></h2>
      <p>
        I reflect upon myself — the me in the mirror,<br>
        the thoughts I pondered yesterday,<br>
        to be reinterpreted by the me of tomorrow,<br>
        so these reflections may lay the foundation for a better future.<br><br>

        And in turn, what I feel now may ripple backward,<br>
        reaching the me of the past,<br>
        letting my resonance echo through time.<br><br>

        I hope this resonance will spread to all the selves<br>
        gazing into their own mirrors throughout the past.<br><br>

        And if, at last, this resonance reaches me — here, now —<br>
        then, quietly, I can disappear.<br><br>

        In that moment, “All of My Selves” is complete.
      </p>
